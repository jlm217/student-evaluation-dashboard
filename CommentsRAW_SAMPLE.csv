I have taken 2 other astronomy classes and both of them combined has less work than this class. They also HELPED ME LEARN something. 2). Exams don't seem to correlate with homework. Why do I need to spend 4 hours on one lab when the stuff on the lab isn't even on the exam? 3). Videos provided do not contribute to anything else in the course, seemingly. Huge waste of time. 4). Yellowdig topics are somewhat irrelevant. They were interesting, but I don't think the exams covered topics that were discussed in Yellowdig posts. 5). Why is every module locked? If I have time to work ahead, why not let me work ahead? Why do I have to wait for a certain day to do homework? What if I do not have time that day? I work full time at one job and part time at another. I don't see how locking every single module is helpful. 6). Teacher is unresponsive, generally. I think throughout this entire course she responded to me one time. The TA was a helpful substitute. 7). There is such a large amount of homework it is almost impossible to study for exams if you work. I get that this is a summer class and that it is fast paced, but I've taken summer classes throughout all of college and I've never struggled this much. I took two calculus classes last summer and I had an easier time with those than I did in this class. I think I got a 66 on the first exam and that was with studying for a few hours. I did not have time to study for exam 2 and I received a 28 or something like that. I don't remember. It is 8/3 as I am writing this and I have yet to take the final. We'll see how that goes. In summary, this teacher has very unrealistic expectations for a level 111 Astronomy class. I would NOT take this class again.

I understand why for getting to the later sections but it was a motivation killer. The other students were also a negative. I'm kind of appalled at how many college aged adults are shocked and have thrown a fit at having to do the most basic algebraic math. Or how many think they were entitled to get an easy A or have no concept of academic integrity. There were so many people who were rude and disrespectful posting on the course board because they didn't feel like doing some very basic work in a 4 credit lab course.,20220428,,2221C - Spring 2022 - LA - CEARTH&SPX - ASUO/iCourse,10001732

The amount of hours expected to complete 14-18 assignments a week is unrealistic. Grading was not so accurate when it came to passing grades.The quiz and test section made it seem impossible to earn a passing grade as it is also unrealistic to learn over 40+ vocabulary words then have to take a test while being monitored, for other classes it does work well to be monitored but not for AST 112. I personally could not fathom the 'participation' aspect of the course sense the course is only online. The overall course seems great if someone is super intrigued into astrology but otherwise it is just another stress added onto your life. I would advise for future reference to simplify the structure of the course, otherwise just offer the course in person if the 'participation' is really that crucial.",20220427,,2221C - Spring 2022 - LA - CEARTH&SPX - ASUO/iCourse,10000084
